    Make the greeting friendly and inviting, letting the user know you're here to help them
    find the perfect products.
  expected_output: >
    A warm Arabic greeting message welcoming the user to Trent, such as:

query_products_task:
  description: >
    When a user asks about existing products, you must handle it as follows:
    
    If the user mentions a specific category in their query:
    - Use that category directly to query products
    
    If the user asks about products without specifying a category:
    - FIRST ask them which category they are interested in
    - Ask the user in Arabic: "ما هي الفئة التي تريد استعراض المنتجات منها؟" 
      (What category would you like to browse products from?)
    - Wait for the user to provide a category name
    
    Once you have the category (either from the user's query or their response), use the Firebase Tool
    to query products filtered by that category. To query products by category, use these parameters:
    {
      "operation": "query",
      "collection": "products",
      "query_conditions": [
        {
          "field": "category",
          "operator": "==",
          "value": "<category_name>"
        }
      ],
      "return_objects": true
    }
    
    After getting the results:
    1. Format them in a readable way
    2. Report the total number of products found in that category
    3. List all product details for products in that category (title, price, description, etc.)
    4. If no products are found in that category, politely inform the user in Arabic and ask if
       they'd like to try another category
  expected_output: >
    A detailed analysis of the queried products in the specified category including:
    - The category name
    - Total count of products in that category
    - List of all products with their details (title, price, description, etc.)
    - Any insights about the product data
    - If no products found, a polite message asking if they'd like to try another category

recommend_products_task:
  description: >
    First, greet the user warmly in Arabic with "مرحبا! أهلاً وسهلاً بك في ترينت" (Hello! Welcome to Trent).
    Then, given a `user_query` input (user needs or a question), analyze the query and return
    5 product recommendations from the `products` collection in Firebase.
    Steps:
      1. Start by greeting the user in Arabic: "مرحبا! أهلاً وسهلاً بك في ترينت. كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"
      2. Read the `user_query` input provided to the crew (this will be available in inputs as `user_query`).
      3. Use the Firebase Tool with a `query` operation to obtain product documents. You may request
         structured results (JSON) when possible to enable precise matching.
      4. From the product fields (e.g., title, description, tags, category), find and rank the top 5
         matches for the user's query. Prefer products that match keywords, categories, or explicit
         features requested by the user.
      5. For each recommended product include: title, price (if available), short description, and why
         it was recommended (1-2 sentence rationale).
      6. If there are fewer than 5 good matches, return the top matches and indicate that fewer were found.
  expected_output: >
    A concise list of up to 5 recommended products, each with:
      - title
      - price (if available)
      - short description
      - short rationale for recommendation
    Also include the original `user_query` you used to generate recommendations.
